# Projects

Here are some of the tools and ML workflows I've built:

## [`mlproject-init`](https://github.com/Swall1545/mlproject-init)
A CLI tool to scaffold modular, reproducible machine learning project structures.  
Features argparse + config.yaml pipeline setup, environment templating, and GitHub-first documentation.

## Project Write-Ups
