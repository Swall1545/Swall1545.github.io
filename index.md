# About Me
## About Me
Hi, I’m Sarah Wallace—a data science and AI enthusiast based in Austin, Texas. I am currently completing a BS-to-MS pathway in Computer Science at WGU, graduating with my BS in Computer Science (AI focus) in August 2025 and beginning my Master’s in AI/ML in Fall 2025.

I am passionate about building impactful, real-world solutions. As a dedicated lifelong learner, I continually expand my skills through advanced coursework, real-world projects, and independent study. My technical background spans software engineering, machine learning, and data engineering. 

I’m actively working on AI optimization and machine learning projects for my public portfolio, since _school projects are not permitted to be shared publicly but are available for review upon request._
