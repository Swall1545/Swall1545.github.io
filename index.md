## About Me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I’m Sarah Wallace - a data science and AI practitioner based in Austin, Texas. I recently earned my B.S. in Computer Science (AI focus) and am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science (AI/ML specialization). My academic and portfolio work spans end-to-end academic ML workflows: data exploration, feature engineering, model training and tuning, cross-validation, interpretability, and leakage audits.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the software engineering side, I’ve built and deployed Java/Spring Boot applications with Docker and REST APIs. This experience provides me with practical deployment exposure, which translates into containerization and API integration skills relevant to ML systems. I also document projects with stakeholder-style reports, highlighting value delivered in ways that resonate with both technical and non-technical audiences.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strong foundation in ML fundamentals, including pipelines, feature engineering, cross-validation, and interpretability, I’m extending those skills into deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. I already have knowledge of gradient descent, GPU acceleration, and neural network architectures from my coursework, and I’m reinforcing this through applied practice with Udemy courses and Google Cloud certification labs. Adopting these frameworks builds on familiar ML principles, with the main learning curve in framework syntax and APIs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve been recognized with academic awards in Computer Science Project Development, Lab Science, and Technical Communication. The Technical Communication award specifically cited my ability to adapt communication to the audience’s goals and roles,  a skill I now apply to bridging the gap between technical teams, stakeholders, and decision-makers. Combined with prior sales experience, this enables me to deliver not only robust ML systems but also clear, actionable insights.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hold an ITIL v4 certification, which integrates Agile, Lean, and DevOps principles into service delivery. This provides me with exposure to Agile-aligned development methodologies and enhances my ability to work effectively in structured, cross-functional program environments. I’m actively seeking opportunities across ML/AI engineering, data science, and AI-focused program management internships, where I can apply this mix of technical depth, analytical rigor, and audience-centered communication.
